Here's the initial assessment of the new *ungrading and feedback*
pedagogy that we implemented this academic year (2022-2023). In a
nutshell, we decided to not mark any of the weekly test and maximise
opportunities for feedback to favour student's self-assessment and
reflection on their work. Read the [full
post](https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/) to learn the reasons and
opportunities for dropping grading the weekly tests and maximise
feedback with students.

## Third bachelor course

Let's start with the third bachelor student's feedback, collected as
part of the 'Year committee' meeting, where student representatives
meet with the professors and share the feedback they collected among
all students.

- While some students do prefer being kept on their toes with marking,
  the majority appreciate dropping marking to reduce stress/pressure
  during weekly tests.

- The general pedagogy and the feedback are well received. In
  particular, students like the post-it and the possibility to book
  one-to-one sessions to get individual feedback.

- This year, we also have the support of a third TA, which helps
  a lot.

The feedback we gathered on the post-it notes after the last lecture
and our subjective appreciation is along the same lines. Some students
already mentioned that they were looking forward to next years
(optional) Master's course, which is a strong argument in favour of
our strategy.

- What about mandatory presence ... ?

## First masters course

This year, for the first time, students were asked to self-mark during
the final oral exam, and all provided a fair assessment of their work,
at times even slightly lower that what they really deserved (in which
case we bumped the mark accordingly). I also systematically asked what
they thought they could have improved and if more time would have
helped. Interestingly, the topic of the last project/presentations,
which was a more open-ended and creative task, was one point that came
up, with analysis approaches that they didn't think of but thought
they should have.

We also considered some further updates for next year, to promote
feedback and allow specific action on that feedback. For the first
report, focusing on a hands-on analysis of RNA-Seq data, here are the
steps that we plan to implement:

1. After receiving their data, students will give a first short
   presentation focusing on presenting their dataset, the experimental
   desing, the biological question(s) they want to ask, and the
   associated statistical model(s). This is a first opportunity for
   feedback to make sure to catch any misdirections early on.
2. A full 4-hour session dedicated to questions and answers on their
   data, the corresponding chapters, and how to prepare the report.
3. A detailed report, written in R markdown and compiled in pdf,
   detailing the analyses introduced in the presentation above (point
   1).
4. We will read and annotate the reports, and provide an individual
   feedback sheet including a short section with positive points, a
   short section with possible improvements and a list of
   questions. The questions we will ask during the end-of-term oral
   exam will be among those in the list, so that students can prepare
   beforehand and thus address any short-comings in their reports.
5. Each students will receive another report to read and provide
   constructive comments. This will allow them to explore how others
   have addressed their project and experience how to critically read
   and assess another person's work (and thus reflect on their own
   contribution).
6. An oral exam to offer the students an opportunity to answer (some
   of) the questions we handed them (point 4).

As every year so far, I have also asked for students to comment on one
aspect of the course they particularly appreciated and one that they
did less, as well as an assessment of the amount of work they had to
invest. It is interesting as it gives them an opportunity to reflect
on the whole course and discuss their impressions with us, which we
use to update and improve the course.

## Next assessments

- We need to consider whether the positive impact that we seem to
  observe in the third bachelor's course also translates into a better
  success rate in the exam. I do have to admit that this makes me
  slightly uncomfortable. What if we were to see a negative impact
  (which, honestly, I doubt)? It wouldn't necessarily mean that we did
  worse, given that it we have applied our new strategy on a single
  cohort. This obviously also applied if we get better results - a
  better success rate might be the result other confounding factors.
- On the other hand, this cohort will be the only that has experienced
  the change in teaching strategy.
- And anyway, I wouldn't want to teach to the test, for the many
  reasons underlying the new [ungrading and
  feedback](https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/) strategy.
- Next term, we start with a brand new second bachelor cohort. This
  will also be an interesting experience, as they will be immediately
  exposed to this same [ungrading and
  feedback](https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/) strategy (with us
  having some experience), and will experience and adapt to it over
  two years.
