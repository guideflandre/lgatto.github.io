Here's the initial assessment of the new [ungrading and
feedback](https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/) approach that we
decided to implement this academic year. In a nutshell, we decided to
not mark any of the weekly test and maximise opportunities for
feedback to favour student's self-assessment and reflection on their
work.

## Third bachelor course

Let's start with the third bachelor student's feedback, collected as
part of the 'Year committee', a meeting between student
representatives that collect feedback among all students and share
them with the professors.

- While some students prefer being kept on their toes with marking,
  the majority do appreciate the change in dropping marking to reduce
  stress/pressure during weekly tests.

- The general pedagogy and the feedback are well received. In
  particular, students like the post-it notes and the possibility to
  get individual feedback.

- This year, we also have the support of a third TA, which helps
  a lot.

The feedback we gathered on the post-it notes after the last lecture
and our subjective appreciation is along the same lines. Some students
already mentioned that they were looking forward to next years
(optional) Master's course, which is a strong argument in favour of
our strategy.

- What about mandatory presence ... ?

## First masters course

This year, for the first time, students were asked to self-mark during
the final oral exam, and all provided a fair assessment of their work,
at times even slightly lower that what they really deserved (in which
case we bumped the mark accordingly). I also systematically asked what
they thought they could have improved and if more time would have
helped. Interestingly, the topic of the last set of student
presentations, which was a more open-ended and creative task, was one
point that came up, with analysis approaches that they didn't think of
but thought they should have.

We also considered some further updates for next year, to promote
feedback and specific action on that feedback. For the first report,
focusing on a hands-on analysis of RNA-Seq data, here are the steps
that we plan to implement:

1. After receiving their data, students will give a short presentation
   focusing on presenting their dataset, the biological question(s)
   they want to ask, and the associated statistical model(s). This is
   a first opportunity for feedback to make sure to address any wrong
   start.
2. A session dedicated to questions and answers.
3. A detailed report, written in R markdown, detailing the analyses
   presented in the presentation above (point 1).
4. We will read and annotate the reports, and provide a feedback sheet
   including a short section with positive points, a short section
   with possible improvements and a list of questions. The questions
   we will ask during the end-of-term oral exam will be among those in
   the list, so that students can prepare beforehand and thus address
   any short-comings in their reports.
5. An oral exam to offer the students an opportunity to answer (some
   of) the questions they have prepared.

As every year so far, I have also asked for the student to comment on
one aspect of the course they particularly appreciated and one that
they did less, as well as an assessment of the amount of work they had
to work. It is interesting as it gives them an opportunity to reflect
over the whole course and share and discuss their impressions with us,
which we use to update and improve the course.

## Next assessments

- We need to consider whether the positive impact that we seem to
  observe in the third bachelor course also translates in a better
  success rate in the exam. I do have to admit that this makes me
  slightly uncomfortable. What if we were to see a negative impact
  (which, honestly I doubt)? It wouldn't necessarily mean that we did
  worse, given that it we have applied our new strategy on a single
  cohort. This obviously also applied if we get better results.
- But on the other hand, this cohort will be the only that has
  experienced the change in teaching strategy.
- And anyway, I wouldn't want to teach to the test anyway, for the
  many reasons underlying the new [ungrading and
  feedback](https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/).
- Next term, we start with a brand new second bachelor cohort. This
  will also be an interesting experience, as they will be immediately
  exposed to the [ungrading and
  feedback](https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/) strategy, and will
  experience and adapt to it over two years.
