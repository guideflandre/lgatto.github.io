Here's the initial assessment of the new *ungrading and feedback*
pedagogy that the TAs and myself implemented this academic year
(2022-2023). In a nutshell, we decided to not mark any of the weekly
test and maximise opportunities for feedback to favour student's
self-assessment and reflection on their own work
(meta-cognition). Read the [full
post](https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/) to learn the reasons and
opportunities for dropping grading the weekly tests and maximise
feedback with students.

## Third bachelor course

Let's start with the third bachelor student's feedback, collected as
part of the 'Year committee' meeting, where student representatives
meet with the professors and share the feedback they collected among
all students. This is a cohort that experienced the previous approach,
where each weekly test was graded and the students that earned a
decent weighted average would get a dispense for the final exam.

- While some students did prefer being kept on their toes with
  marking, the majority appreciate dropping marking to reduce
  stress/pressure during weekly tests.

- The general pedagogy and the feedback are well received. In
  particular, students like the post-it notes for in-class
  interactions and feedback and the possibility to book one-to-one
  sessions to get individual feedback.

- This year, we also have the support of a third TA, which helps a lot
  to provide prompt technical help and answer questions without delay
  during class.

The feedback we gathered on the post-it notes after the last lecture
and our subjective appreciation is along the same lines. Some students
already mentioned on the post-it notes that they were looking forward
to next year's (optional) Master's course, which is a strong argument
in favour of our strategy.

- What about mandatory presence ... ?

## First masters course

This year, for the first time, students were asked to self-mark during
the final oral exam. They all provided a fair assessment of their
work, at times even slightly lower that what they really deserved (in
which case we obviously bumped the mark accordingly). I also
systematically asked what they thought they could have improved and if
more time would have helped. Interestingly, the topic of the last
project/presentations, which was a more open-ended and creative task,
was one point that came up repeatedly, with analysis approaches that
they didn't think of but thought they should have.

We also considered some further updates for next year, to promote
feedback and allow students to act specifically on that feedback. For
the first report, that focuses on a [hands-on analysis of RNA-Seq
data](https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/WSBIM2122/sec-rnaseq.html),
here are the steps that we plan to implement:

1. After receiving their data, students will give a first short
   presentation focusing on introducing their dataset, the
   experimental design, the biological question(s) they want to focus
   on, and the associated statistical model(s). This is a first
   opportunity for feedback and to make sure we catch any
   misdirections early on.
2. A full 4-hour session dedicated to questions and answers on their
   data, the corresponding chapters, and how to prepare the report.
3. A report, written in R markdown and compiled in pdf, detailing the
   analyses introduced in the presentation above (point 1).
4. We will read and annotate the reports, and provide an individual
   feedback sheet including a short section with positive points, a
   short section with possible improvements and a list of
   questions. The questions we will ask during the end-of-term oral
   exam (point 6 below) will be among those in this list, so that
   students can prepare beforehand and thus address any short-comings
   in their respective reports.
5. Each students will receive another report to read and provide
   constructive comments. This will allow them to explore how others
   have addressed their project and experience how to critically read
   and assess another person's work (and thus reflect on their own
   contribution).
6. An oral exam to offer the students an opportunity to answer (some
   of) the questions we handed them (point 4).

As every year so far, I have also asked for students to comment on one
aspect of the course they particularly appreciated and one that they
did less, as well as an assessment of the amount of work they had to
invest. This is interesting as it provides them with an opportunity to
reflect on the whole course and discuss their impressions with us,
which we use to update and improve the course.

## Next assessments

- We need to consider whether the positive impact that we seem to
  observe in the third bachelor's course also translates into a better
  success rate in the exam. I do have to admit that this makes me
  slightly uncomfortable. What if we were to see a negative impact
  (which, honestly, I doubt)? It wouldn't necessarily mean that we did
  worse, given that we have applied our new strategy on a single
  cohort. This obviously also applied if we get better results - a
  better or worse success rate might be the result other confounding
  factors.
- On the other hand, this cohort will be the only that has experienced
  the change in teaching strategy.
- If I'm being honest, I wouldn't want to teach to the test, for the
  many reasons underlying the new [ungrading and
  feedback](https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/) strategy.
- Next term, we start with a brand new second bachelor cohort. This
  will also be an interesting experience, as they will be immediately
  exposed to this [ungrading and
  feedback](https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/) strategy (with us
  having a term's worth experience), and will experience and adapt to
  it over two years.
