This is not going to be a happy post. I am going to report on my
academic open science activities for the last 10 months or so. I will
describe how my efforts (and those of several fellow scholars, but I
am writing in my own name only) have been ignored at the national,
institutional and local level. 

## National level - Joint Information Systems Committee JISC catastrophy

## Institutional level - the Journal Steering Committee disaster

## Local level - Department of Biochemistry apathy

## ECR efforts

### Letter to the Pro-VC

### Letter to the board of scrutiny


### Recent changes:

- 2 people JCS consultative meetings
- 1 person on JCS working group
- Bullied into Bad Science
