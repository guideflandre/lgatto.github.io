Every now and then, there's a situation where I need to briefly
introduce myself, academically. This can be with or without any visual
support (i.e a slide). Instead of doing so semi-randomly, I though I
would prepare such a one-minute introduction, once an for all. So here
I go, with a nice illustrative [heck-sticker slide]() and plenty of
links.

[Add screenshot here.]

- I am [Laurent Gatto](http://lgatto.github.io/about), professor of
  bioinformatics at the [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/). I teach at
  the [Faculty of pharmacy and biomedical sciences]() and run a
  computation biology lab at the [de Duve institute]().

- The lab's research focuses on developing statistical and machine
  learning methods to process, explore and comprehend high-dimensional
  biological data, such as typically produces by omics
  technologies. Working on the university biomedical campus, we deploy
  our work on clinically and biomedically relevant research projects,
  in collaboration with other laboratories on the campus.

- I am committed to the open, transparent and rigorous practice of
  scientific enquiry. In particular, we make every possible effort to
  make our [research repeatable, reproducible and
  replicable](http://lgatto.github.io/rr-what-should-be-our-goals/).

- The development and publication of scientific software (see
  [here](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/),
  [here](https://github.com/lgatto) and
  [here](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/)) is an integral
  part of my work and is reflected by my contributions to the
  [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) project.

- I also serve on the Bioconductor [technical advisory board](),
  [European Bioconductor
  Society](https://bioconductor.org/about/european-bioconductor-society/),
  [education and teaching committee]() and the [Code of conduct
  committee]().
