Today, I'm going to introduce a recent feature from the
[Spectra](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Spectra/) package,
namely annotated chromatograms. I'll start by showing the result and
them explain how to produce it.

## An annotated chromatogram

You will immediately recognise a chromatogram on the figure below,
showing MS1 scan total ion current over the experiment's retention
time. Each MS1 event is highlighted by a dot which is colour-coded
based on the number of MS2 offspring scans that lead to
identifications. Grey dots are MS1 scans without any identified
precursor peaks while coloured dots (from dark to light blue)
represent MS1 scans have 1 to 10 (in one case, see details below)
identified precursor peaks.

You can also watch a video illustrating this post [here](https://youtu.be/skOfnVeJc_U).

## The data

The generate the data for an annotated chromatogram, we need raw and
identification data and join them together. We will use the
*TMT_Erwinia* data available in the
[msdata](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/msdata.html). Below,
we get the raw and identification data files.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("msdata")
basename(mzml_file <- proteomics(pattern = "20141210.mzML", full.names = TRUE))
basename(mzid_file <- ident(pattern = "20141210.mzid", full.names = TRUE))
```

Here, we load the raw data into R as a `Spectra` object:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("Spectra")
rw <- Spectra(mzml_file)
rw
```

Below, we load the identification data into R as a `PSM` object and
filter the PSMs:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("PSMatch")
id <- PSM(mzid_file) |>
   filterPSMs()
id
```


We can now annotate the spectra with the identification data. For
details about these steps, see the details and example of the
[joinSpectraData()](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Spectra/reference/Spectra.html#data-subsetting-filtering-and-merging-1)
function.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
rw <- joinSpectraData(rw, id,
                by.x = "spectrumId",
                by.y = "spectrumID")
head(na.omit(rw$sequence))
```

## The `countIdentifications()` function

The function that permit to produce the data for the figure above is
[countIdentifications()](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Spectra/reference/countIdentifications.html).


The function is going to tally the number of identifications (i.e
non-missing characters in the `sequence` spectra variable) for each
scan. In the case of MS2 scans, these will be either 1 or 0, depending
the presence of a sequence. For MS1 scans, the function will count the
number of sequences for the descendant MS2 scans, i.e. those produced
from precursor ions from each MS1 scan.

```{r}
rw <- countIdentifications(rw)
```

Below, we see on the second line that 3457 MS2 scans lead to no PSM,
while 2546 lead to an identification. Among all MS1 scans, 833 lead to
no MS2 scans with PSMs. 30 MS1 scans generated one MS2 scan that lead
to a PSM, 45 lead to two PSMs, ...

```{r}
table(msLevel(rw), rw$countIdentifications)
```

We can now use this new `countIdentifications` variable to generate
our annotated chromatogram. The code chunk below filters MS1 level
data and then extracts the spectra variable, in particular the
retention time `rtime`, the total ion current `totIonCurrent` and the
newly created `countIdentifications` to produce a figure with
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).


```{r countIdentificationsFig, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.path = "images/"}
library(tidyverse)
rw |>
filterMsLevel(1) |>
spectraData() |>
as_tibble() |>
ggplot(aes(x = rtime,
           y = totIonCurrent)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.25) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = ifelse(countIdentifications == 0,
                                   NA, countIdentifications)),
               size = 1,
               alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(colour = "Number of ids")
```
