&lt;a href=&quot;https://uclouvain.be/&quot;&gt;UCLouvain&lt;/a&gt; University museum in
Louvain-la-Neuve. Highly recommended. It’s located to the lively
&lt;em&gt;place des sciences&lt;/em&gt;, in a nice brutalist style building, formerly the
science university library. If you ever spend some time in
Louvain-la-Neuve, do spare a couple of hours to visit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an academic and an ‘amis du musée’, I can get in for free, and
sometimes enjoy the quiet and rather unique atmosphere to get some
work. The previous exhibition, named &lt;a href=&quot;https://museel.be/fr/evenement/visite-guidee/decouvrir-lexposition-grid-0&quot;&gt;The
Grid&lt;/a&gt;,
was dedicated to the use of a grid in science. The poster and book of
the exhibition, shown below, shows a grid, formed of smaller, slightly
irregular squares. I thought this was a funny example to reproduce in
R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/grid-poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Grid poster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I need is the be able to draw squares. The
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plotSquare()&lt;/code&gt; function below plots on of width &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; at positions
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plotSquare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming I want an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nsq&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nsq&lt;/code&gt; grid of squares, below, I define
that value to be 10, to draw a total of 100 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## Number of squares&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nsq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want some jitter, i.e. some random displacements from a perfect
10 by 10 alignment, set by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;amount&lt;/code&gt; variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## amount of square jittering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I need to define how much space is dedicated to the border
between the squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## border ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the grid will have a width and a height of 100
(arbitrary) unites, below I define the width &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sq_w&lt;/code&gt; of a square,
considering the number of squares and the space that is dedicated to
the border between squares. One I have the with of a square, I can
compute the width &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;border_w&lt;/code&gt; of the border between two squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sq_w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nsq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;border_w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nsq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sq_w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nsq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can now compute the x and y position of my squares. Given that my
final grid is a square itself, these x and y positions apply to rows
and columns of squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;seq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;border_w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;border_w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;length.out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nsq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now produce the figure. I first define the margins of my plot
with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;par&lt;/code&gt; function: the margins have width 1 and outer
margins 0. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plot()&lt;/code&gt; function doesn’t plot anything (`type = “n”),
no axes, no frame, no labels. It however sets a grid itself, ranging
from -2 to 100, to accommodate my squares and borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;par&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;rep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;oma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;rep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;-2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;border_w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;-2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;border_w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xaxt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;yaxt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xlab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ylab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;frame.plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;FALSE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step is to place the squares. The x and y positions are
symmetrical, i.e defined by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt; variable above: the lines and
columns are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pos[1]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pos[2]&lt;/code&gt;, …, respectively, and the squares are
added line by line, starting at line at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pos[1]&lt;/code&gt;. A little amount of

&lt;p&gt;Parmi les points abordés, il y avait la question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Quelle serait l’évaluation idéale?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;qui a suscité la réflexion suivante.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L’évaluation se doit avant tout d’être au service de la
formation. L’évaluation certificative est pour moi une voie sans
issue, que j’ai beaucoup de mal à percevoir comment elle fait partie
de ma mission d’enseignement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/eval.png&quot; alt=&quot;Évaluations certificative :-( et formative :-)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour moi, une évaluation idéale, c’est une formalité, c’est une
évaluation qui n’a pas raison d’être, car les intervenant(e)s du cours
savent que les étudiant(e)s maîtrisent la matière, et que l’évaluation
finale n’est qu’une formalité, et qu’elle n’est donc plus nécessaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Le but d’un enseignement serait donc de rendre l’évaluation
certificative irrelevante, de faire en sorte qu’elle ne soit plus
pertinente, de la rendre impertinente.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laurent Gatto</name></author><category term="teaching" /><category term="education" /><category term="UCLouvain" /><summary type="html">Une fois n’est pas coutume, un billet en français, pour attirer votre attention sur les podcasts du LLL.

platform for the lab, even before moving to Belgium. Based on the
access log, I set up the lab slack workspace in June 2016. It has
proven very useful, even with the more recent limitations that come
with the free slack plan. I have been thinking for some time that I
should move to an open source offering. Based on a little bit of
reading
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ossph.org/best-open-source-alternatives-to-slack/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.com/alternatives/slack&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and asking on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://fosstodon.org/@lgatto/111840609295851868&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;,
there were a couple of contenders:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mattermost.com/&quot;&gt;Mattermost&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://element.io/&quot;&gt;element.io&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rocket.chat/&quot;&gt;rocket.chat&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/&quot;&gt;Zulip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My needs are pretty simple: I would like to have access to all
messages, and apps for various desktop and mobile OSes. Cost is also
an issue - with say 15 users at around 7$ per month, it would cost the
lab over 1200$ per year. While not a big amount per se for an academic
lab, given the restrictions of what can be paid for from academic
funding (salary only or consumable, for example), that money is money
that couldn’t be used to support students with their travelling to
conferences. I thus considered self-hosting, but it wasn’t clear I
could get the support from IT, a public facing IP, with the necessary
port accessible to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered that Zulip offers their Cloud Standard plan for
&lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/for/research/&quot;&gt;free for academic research&lt;/a&gt;, which
is what I finally went for with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cbio.zulipchat.com&lt;/code&gt;. They ask to
acknowledge their support on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/&quot;&gt;lab
webpage&lt;/a&gt; (see at the bottom),
which is a fair request. The sponsorship was accepted on the day, and
a couple of days later, their support
&lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack&quot;&gt;imported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; all the
slack messages from our non-private channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, all works very smoothly, and I’m quite happy. The web
interface and the GNU/Linux and Android apps work very well. I think
I’m also liking the possibility to provide a title to posts/threads -
future will tell if all members make use of this. Another useful
difference with slack (at least the free plan) is there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://zulip.com/help/roles-and-permissions&quot;&gt;guest
accounts&lt;/a&gt; (that are
given access to specific streams/channels when joining), in addition
to regular members (who can join all public streams).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fn&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even if one can only see the last messages with a free slack
plan, all messages from public channels get exported. This, and a
bot user OAuth token is all they need. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fn&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;poster-a-reliable-and-reproducible-resource-for-ct-genes&quot;&gt;Poster: A reliable and reproducible resource for CT genes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie Devis, Axelle Loriot, Charles De Smet and Laurent Gatto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer-Testis (CT) genes are tissue-specific genes whose expression is
limited to the germline. They are normally repressed in somatic
tissues, but can be aberrantly activated in tumors. For many CT genes,
tumoral activation is enabled by loss of promoter DNA methylation. CT
genes are of great interest. First, they have clinical potential as
cancer-specific antigens, and can thus be used as target for cancer
immunotherapy and as cancer biomarkers. Second, they are also a good
model to study DNA demethylation in cancer, which is still poorly
understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of CT genes differs vastly according to the literature
source. Some databases already exist [1,2,3] but they are neither
up-to-date nor well annotated, and thus difficult to use. There is
therefore a need for a reliable and reproducible resource when
studying CT genes. We therefor created CTexploreR, a package that
rigorously defines and explores CT genes. Our main objective was to
propose a reliable and well-defined list of CT genes based on publicly
available RNAseq databases.  We also determined their precise
transcription start site in order to be able to realise an accurate
promoter methylation analysis. Our list contains 307 CT genes that
were carefully classified as regulated by DNA methylation or not. We
also developed functions to visualise CT genes expression and promoter
DNA methylation in normal and tumoral tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also performed a thorough comparison of CTexploreR with the
available resources mentioned above. It allowed us to clearly
establish and characterise the difference between CT lists and clarify
the origins of the inconsistencies. These analyses demonstrate that
CTexploreR is a clear, curated and rigorously established up-to-date
reference. Our package can thus be used as the starting point for
further investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philippe Hauchamps, Dan Lin and Laurent Gatto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the increase of the dimensionality in conventional flow cytometry
data over the past years, there is a growing need to replace or
complement traditional manual analysis (i.e. iterative 2D gating) with
automated data analysis pipelines. Examples of such pipelines have
been documented in the recent literature (e.g. [1],[2],[3]). A crucial
part of these pipelines consists of pre-processing and applying
quality control filtering to the raw data, in order to use high
quality events in the downstream statistical analysis. This part can
in turn be split into a number of elementary steps : margin events
removal, signal compensation, scale transformations, debris and dead
cells removal, batch effect correction,… etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when designing automated flow cytometry data analysis
pipelines, assembling and assessing the pre-processing part can be
challenging for a number of reasons. First, each of the involved
elementary steps can be implemented using various methods and R
packages. Second, the order of the steps can have an impact on the
downstream analysis results. Finally, each method typically comes with
its specific, unstandardized diagnostic and visualizations, making
objective comparison difficult for the end user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we present CytoPipeline, an R package suite for building,
assessing and comparing pre-processing pipelines for flow cytometry
data. To exemplify our tool, we present the steps involved in
designing a pre-processing pipeline on a real life dataset and
demonstrate the visualization utilities. We also show how CytoPipeline
can nicely complement benchmarking tools, like e.g. PipeComp [4], by
providing user intuitive insight into benchmarking results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;poster-fmsne---fast-multi-scale-neighbour-embedding-in-r&quot;&gt;Poster: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fmsne&lt;/code&gt; - fast multi-scale neighbour embedding in R&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laurent Gatto and Cyril de Bodt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimensionality reduction (DR) has been a workhorse of large scale,
multivariate omics data analysis from the early days. Since the advent
of single-cell RNA sequencing, non-linear approaches have taken the
front stage, with t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE)
[1,2] being one of, if not the main player. Packages such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Rtsne&lt;/code&gt;
[3] and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scater&lt;/code&gt; [4] have made it easy to apply t-SNE in
R/Bioconductor workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One sticking point with t-SNE is the single perplexity parameter, that
controls the number of nearest high-dimensional (HD) neighbours that
are taken into account when constructing the low-dimensional (LD)
embedding: small (resp. large) values only enable preserving small
(resp. large) neighbourhoods from HD to LD during DR, impairing the
reproduction of large (resp. small) neighbourhoods. It is thus a key
parameter, especially if the LD embedding is used for interpretation,
which is often the case in omics-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-scale neighbour embedding [5] is an extension to single-scale
approaches such as t-SNE, that exempt users from having to set a
single perplexity (scale) arbitrarily. Multi-scale approaches maximise
the LD embedding quality at all scales, preserving both local and
global HD neighbourhoods [6]. They have been shown to better capture
the structure of data and to significantly improve DR quality [7].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we present &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fmsne&lt;/code&gt; (https://github.com/lgatto/fmsne), an R
package that relies on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;basiliks&lt;/code&gt; package [8] to provide
Bioconductor-friendly interface to fast multi-scale methods
implemented in python. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fmsne&lt;/code&gt; implements fast multi-scale functions
such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;runFMSTSNE()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plotFMSTSNE()&lt;/code&gt;, based on scater’s
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scater::run*()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scater::plot*()&lt;/code&gt; interface [4]. It also exposes
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;drQuality()&lt;/code&gt; function to assess DR quality using rank-based
criteria [7]. Finally, we illustrate fast multi-scale methods on
various single-cell datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;talk-linear-models-for-single-cell-proteomics&quot;&gt;Talk: Linear models for single-cell proteomics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christophe Vanderaa and Laurent Gatto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS)-based single-cell proteomics (SCP) has become a
credible player in the single-cell biology arena [1,2]. Continuous
technical improvements have pushed the boundaries of sensitivity and
throughput. However, the computational efforts to support the analysis
of these complex data have been missing. Strong batch effects coupled
to high proportions of missing values complicate the analysis, causing
strong entanglement between biological and technical variability
[3,4].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose a simple, yet powerful approach to address this need:
linear models. We use linear regression to model and remove undesired
technical factors while retaining the biological variability, even in
the presence of high proportions of missing values. The key advantage
of linear models lies in the interpretability of the results they
generate. Inspired by previous research [5], we streamlined modelling
and exploration of the patterns induced by known technical and
biological factors. The exploration enables a thorough assessment of
the model coefficients, and highlights key factors influencing
SCP experiments. Further exploration of the unmodelled variance
recovers unknown but biologically relevant patterns in the data,
leveraging the power of single-cell proteomics technologies. We
successfully applied our approach to a diverse collection of SCP
datasets [6], and could demonstrate that it is also amenable for
integrating datasets acquired using different technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We implemented and documented this approach in our Bioconductor
package scp [7]. In summary, our approach represents a turning point
for principled SCP data analysis, moving the tension point from how to
perform the analysis to result generation and interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johannes Rainer, Sebastian Gibb, Laurent Gatto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) data is a key technology in modern metabolomics and
proteomics experiments. Continuous improvements in MS instrumentation, larger
experiments and new technological developments lead to ever growing data sizes
and increased number of available variables making &lt;em&gt;standard&lt;/em&gt; in-memory data
handling and processing difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Spectra&lt;/code&gt; package provides a modern infrastructure for MS data handling
specifically designed to enable extension to additional data resources or
alternative data representations. These can be realized by extending the virtual
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MsBackend&lt;/code&gt; class and its related methods. Implementations of such &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MsBackend&lt;/code&gt;
classes can be tailored for specific needs, such as low memory footprint, fast
processing, remote data access, or also support for specific additional data
types or variables. Importantly, data processing of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Spectra&lt;/code&gt; objects is
independent of the backend in use due to a &lt;em&gt;lazy evaluation&lt;/em&gt; mechanism that
caches data manipulations internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop discusses different available data representations for MS data
along with their properties, advantages and performances. In addition,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Spectra&lt;/code&gt;’s concept of lazy evaluation for data manipulations is presented, as
well as a simple caching mechanism for data modifications. Finally, it explains
how new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MsBackend&lt;/code&gt; instances can be implemented and tested to ensure
compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laurent Gatto, Sebastien Gibb and Johannes Rainer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the RforMassSpectrometry initiative
(https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/) is to provide efficient,
thoroughly documented, tested and flexible R software for the analysis
and interpretation of high throughput mass spectrometry assays. In
this software demo, we will demonstrate three software packages that
are central for proteomics data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Spectra package [1], that defines an efficient infrastructure
for storing and handling mass spectrometry spectra and functionality
to subset, process, visualise and compare spectra data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PSMatch package [2] allows to load, process and analyse
peptide-spectrum matches, and can, among others, explore and
deconvolute the peptide-protein (group) relations using adjacency
matrices and connected components.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The QFeatures package [3] provides infrastructure to management and
process quantitative features for high-throughput mass spectrometry
assay, in particular so across assay levels (such as precursors,
peptide spectrum matches, peptides and proteins or protein groups)
in a coherent and tractable format.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will conclude by illustrating how the MsExperiment package [5] can
be used to bundle these three types of data together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuel Grégoire, Sébastien Pyr dit Ruys, Christophe Vanderaa, Didier Vertommen and Laurent Gatto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single-cell proteomics (SCP) aims at studying cellular heterogeneity
by focusing on the functional effectors of the cells, proteins. While
this is essential to identify cells undergoing subtle processes and
point out underlying relevant protein and proteoform abundance
patterns, assessing protein content inside a single cell is
challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to recent breakthroughs in mass spectrometry and sample
processing, it has become possible to increase the depth of proteome
covered, reduce the time needed to analyse a cell and make this
technology more accessible [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, extracting meaningful biological information from this type
of data requires robust and suitable data analysis methods. Progress
in this field is tempered by the lack of standardised
workflows. Currently, data analysis workflows are custom made and
substantially different from one research team to another
[2]. Moreover, it is difficult to evaluate specific steps or entire
pipelines as ground truths are missing. In an effort to bridge the gap
towards the standardisation of SCP data analysis, our team has
developed the scp package [3] relying on the QFeatures and
SingleCellExperiment infrastructures to provide a standardised
framework for SCP data analysis. In addition, we produced our own SCP
datasets to constitute a basis for data analysis benchmarking. To this
end, we used a design containing cell lines mixed in known proportions
to generate controlled variability [4].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we used the scp package to test different combinations
of data processing steps and evaluated them using our ground truth
data. We illustrate how we benefited from this modular, standardised
framework and highlight some crucial steps.&lt;/p&gt;

results of a single acquisition against a fractionation of the same
samples over 7 fractions, tallying a total of 140 raw files. This
required a more powerful computer… running GNU/Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first reference was the following
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHdvO1M85VM&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; by Pavel
Sinitcyn, a post-doc in the MaxQuant team. There’s no actual
installation of MaxQuant - the binaries simply need to be
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=maxquant:common:download_and_installation#download_and_installation_guide&quot;&gt;downloaded&lt;/a&gt;
and unzipped. The challenge is however to install the infrastructure
to run MaxQuant’s C# code on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructions in the video suggested to install &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotnet&lt;/code&gt;, as
documented
&lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu#&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This
didn’t work under Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure of the reason… I had to install &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotnet&lt;/code&gt; 3.1 (even
though 2.1 was mentioned in the video above), an older version than
the one available by default on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotnet&lt;/code&gt; version 3.1
itself depended of an older version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libssl&lt;/code&gt;, namely &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libss1&lt;/code&gt;, that
wasn’t available on ubuntu (again, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libssl3&lt;/code&gt; was the default
version). I had to download and compile &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libss1&lt;/code&gt; by hand, which seemed
to be successful, but ended up with a crashing MaxQuant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I followed &lt;a href=&quot;https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/a/13901&quot;&gt;these
instructions&lt;/a&gt;, that
suggested to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mono&lt;/code&gt;, and installing it via &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conda&lt;/code&gt;. This proved to
be successful. I will be using that setup in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# create the environment
conda create -n maxquant -c conda-forge mono
# activate the environment
conda activate maxquant
# run any maxquant version
mono /path/to/maxquant/bin/MaxQuantCmd.exe mqpar.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that there’s also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/DockerizeMaxQuant&quot;&gt;MaxQuant docker
container&lt;/a&gt;, but
for an older version of MQ, 1.6.5.0, while the current one (at the
time of writing) is 2.2.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run -it nickdg/maxquant
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t find a up-to-date MaxQuant container elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-and-debugging&quot;&gt;Running and debugging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once installed, running MaxQuant is only a matter of passing it a
parameter file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mono /path/to/maxquant/bin/MaxQuantCmd.exe mqpar.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That parameter can be generated using the GUI on Windows, and adapted
for linux by changing the paths to the data and fasta file folders
using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--changeFolder&lt;/code&gt; argument . This is described in detail in
the instruction video above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;debugging&quot;&gt;Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The run crashed after just under a week’s continuous run. I started
the job remotely and lost the output, so didn’t have any error
messages to try to identify the cause. I knew that the first MS/MS
search was underway and thus resumed the run at that step/job, using
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt; argument. To find that job index, one can perform a dry run
with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--dryrun&lt;/code&gt; argument. This will list all the steps as defined
in the parameter file and their respective ids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mono /path/to/maxquant/bin/MaxQuantCmd.exe --dryrun mqpar.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take note the index &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; of the step you want to resume your run with
and run it with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mono /path/to/maxquant/bin/MaxQuantCmd.exe -p N mqpar.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as expected, the error happened again, but this time I managed to
capture the output:&lt;/p&gt;

pedagogy that the TAs and myself have implemented this academic year
(2022-2023). In a nutshell, we decided to not mark any of the weekly
test and maximise opportunities for feedback to favour student’s
self-assessment and reflection on their own work
(meta-cognition). Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/&quot;&gt;full
post&lt;/a&gt; to read about the reasons
and opportunities for dropping grading the weekly tests and maximise
feedback with students.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initial assessment is split into several parts, describing
different sources of data used for the assessment. The different parts
have been added over different times. Part 1 was originally added on
15 December 2022 and is based on direct, free-form informal and
semi-formal feedback. Part 2 is based on on-line evaluation forms that
students were invited to fill out and was published on 27 December
2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-1&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;third-bachelor-course&quot;&gt;Third bachelor course&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the third bachelor student’s feedback, collected as
part of the ‘Year committee’, where student representatives meet with
the professors and share the feedback they collected among all
students. This is a cohort that experienced the previous approach,
where each weekly test was graded and students that earned a decent
weighted average would get a dispense for the final exam&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some students did prefer being kept on their toes with
marking, the majority appreciate dropping marking to reduce
stress/pressure during weekly tests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The general pedagogy and the feedback are well received. In
particular, students like the post-it notes for in-class
interactions and feedback, and the possibility to book one-to-one
sessions to get individual feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, we also have the support of a third TA, which helps a lot
to provide prompt technical help and answer questions without delay
during class.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feedback we gathered on the post-it notes after the last lecture
and our subjective appreciation (based on the perceived motivation of
students, and the quantity and quality of their questions) is along
the same lines. Some students already mentioned on the post-it notes
that they were looking forward to next year’s (optional) Master’s
course, which is a strong argument in favour of our strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-masters-course&quot;&gt;First masters course&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, for the first time, students were asked to self-mark during
the final oral exam. They all provided a fair assessment of their
work, at times even slightly lower that what they really deserved (in
which case we obviously bumped the mark accordingly). I also
systematically asked what they thought they could have improved and if
more time would have helped. Interestingly, the topic of the last
project/presentations, which was a more open-ended and creative task,
was one point that came up repeatedly, with analysis approaches that
they didn’t think of but thought they should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also considered some further updates for next year, to promote
feedback and allow students to act specifically on that feedback. For
the first report, that focuses on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/WSBIM2122/sec-rnaseq.html&quot;&gt;hands-on analysis of RNA-Seq
data&lt;/a&gt;,
here are the steps that we plan to implement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After receiving their data, students will give a first short
presentation focusing on introducing their dataset, the
experimental design, the biological question(s) they want to focus
on, and the associated statistical model(s). This is a first
opportunity for feedback and to make sure we catch any
misdirections early on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A full 4-hour session dedicated to questions and answers on their
data, the corresponding chapters, and how to prepare the report.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A report, written in R markdown and compiled in pdf, detailing the
analyses introduced in the presentation above (point 1).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will read and annotate the reports, and provide an individual
feedback sheet including a short section with positive points, a
short section with possible improvements and a list of
questions. The questions we will ask during the end-of-term oral
exam (point 6 below) will be among those in this list, so that
students can prepare beforehand and thus address any short-comings
in their respective reports.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each students will receive another report to read and provide
constructive comments. This will allow them to explore how others
have addressed their project and experience how to critically read
and assess another person’s work (and thus reflect on their own
contribution).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An oral exam to offer the students an opportunity to answer (some
of) the questions we handed them (point 4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As every year so far, I have also asked for students to comment on one
aspect of the course they particularly appreciated and one that they
did less, as well as an assessment of the amount of work they had to
invest. This is interesting as it provides them with an opportunity to
reflect on the whole course and discuss their impressions with us,
which we use to update and improve the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-assessments&quot;&gt;Next assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to consider whether the positive impact that we seem to
observe in the third bachelor’s course also translates into a better
success rate in the exam. I do have to admit that this makes me
slightly uncomfortable. What if we were to see a negative impact
(which, honestly, I doubt)? It wouldn’t necessarily mean that we did
worse, given that we have applied our new strategy on a single
cohort. This obviously also applied if we get better results - a
better or worse success rate might be the result other confounding
factors. However, this cohort will be the only that has experienced
the change in teaching strategy, and hence probably an ideal situation
for a direct assessment. If I’m being honest, I wouldn’t want to teach
to the test even if exam results were provable worse, for the many
reasons underlying the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/&quot;&gt;ungrading and
feedback&lt;/a&gt; strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next term, we start with a brand new second bachelor cohort. This will
also be an interesting experience, as they will be immediately exposed
to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/&quot;&gt;ungrading and feedback&lt;/a&gt;
strategy (with us having a term’s worth experience), and will
experience and adapt&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to it over two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-2&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-line-questionnaire&quot;&gt;On-line questionnaire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second part of the assessment looks at on-line evaluation forms
that 3rd bachelor students are asked to fill out. There are two types
of forms: one for the teaching unit (i.e the theoretical part of the
course) and a second one for the practical sessions. These evaluation
forms can be requested by the instructor or the faculty (and are
indeed asked for every three years by the latter, if I remember
well). I have three forms available, for two different cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evaluations for the teaching unit from 2021. That’s one that I
requested myself. Given that my courses blend theory and practice,
I only requested the teaching unit questions, asking students to
fill out the form considering both aspects. This form was completed
by 27 students (individual questions were answered by 25 to 27
students), corresponding to half of the class.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evaluations for the teaching unit and practicals from 2022. These
were requested by the faculty, hence for both parts. The requests
and links to the forms where received after completion of the
course, and I was only able to inform and remind students through
forum announcements, hence a low participation rate: only 7
students (with one question getting 6 answers), corresponding to
just under 12% of the full cohort. This probably induces some bias,
where only the most committed students, and hence those more likely
to provide positive feedback, participated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the score for the 2022 teaching unit and practical
sessions. The student answer each question&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by providing a score
from 1 (&lt;em&gt;Don’t agree at all&lt;/em&gt;) to 4 (&lt;em&gt;Totally agree&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/eval_scores_ue_22.png&quot; alt=&quot;2022 evaluations for the teaching unit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/eval_scores_tp_22.png&quot; alt=&quot;2022 evaluations for the practical sessions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These evaluation are quite good, especially when compared
to 2021. Below are the questions for the teaching unit of that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/eval_scores_ue_21.png&quot; alt=&quot;2021 evaluations for the teaching unit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also computed the mean scores and standard deviations per question
to directly compare the 2021 and 2022 results. The figure below show
the 2021 results in the top left panel and the 2022 results in the top
right and bottom left panels. The top right panel is helpful to
compare individual questions and the bottom panel to get a more
general assessment of the 2021 vs 2022 scores. The dotted red line
represents the yearly mean score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/eval_mean_ue_21_22.png&quot; alt=&quot;Comparison of mean 2021 and 2022 scores for the teaching unit evaluations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improvement is striking, to say the least. There are however two
points to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2022, given that the evaluation request came in late, it is
possible that only the most committed students participated, hence
boosting these scores up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 2021 cohort had a hard time during the COVID lock-down. They had
to follow the second bachelor course (a prerequisite to the one
evaluated above) remotely, which was hard on them and is likely to
reduce the overall score.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even considering the above possible confounding factors, I am tempted
to take the figures from the student on-line evaluations as a strong
endorsement for the new teaching strategy. Hopefully, this will also
materialise in a likely part 3 to this post, describing the final exam
results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The latter does read like a nice opportunity for students but do read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/&quot;&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt; for dropping this, and learn about the perverse incentives of such an approach. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;adapting&lt;/em&gt; is quite important here. Students adapt at whatever the system throws at them, all too often for the worse… here, I hope for the better. What we propose is quite different from what they are used to, so it does take some adaptation. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

instructor&lt;/a&gt;
training as an early career researcher. By then, I had only taught a
few workshops, and was very impressed by the content of the training,
and by &lt;a href=&quot;https://third-bit.com/&quot;&gt;Greg Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, who delivered it with
touching sincerity and dedication. A couple of years later, I managed
to secure some funding from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.r-consortium.org/&quot;&gt;R
Consortium&lt;/a&gt; to organise an instructor
course in Cambridge, where I worked at the time, and was delighted to
be able to revisit the content. The Carpentries approach to lesson
design and teaching has stuck with me since then. I have applied these
principles and some of the material to my main university courses
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/WSBIM1207&quot;&gt;WSBIM1207&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/WSBIM1207&quot;&gt;WSBIM1322&lt;/a&gt; for the second and third bachelor
courses respectively and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/WSBIM2122&quot;&gt;WSBIM2122&lt;/a&gt; for the
master’s course), and am now, as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bioconductor.org/help/education-training/&quot;&gt;Bioconductor Teaching
committee&lt;/a&gt;,
developing new lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering good courses at workshops isn’t an easy task, but everybody
can get there with the right preparation and support (such as proposed
by the Carpentries). There is however one aspect that makes it
&lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; than teaching a university curriculum: as an workshop
instructor, you focus on the day (or days) you teach, giving your
best, and then it’s over - no need to think about
tomorrow. Participants will hopefully apply what they have learnt,
some might get back to you with questions (extremely rare in my
experience), but others might not and you’ll never hear from them. In
a university setting, on the other hand, you have to think about
assignments, test, exams, marks, … and possibly even about
pre-requisites for follow-up classes. You have to be able to assess
the students, i.e. assess whether they have acquired (enough of) the
material, and whether they are sufficiently well prepared for next
year’s class and, more generally, their future activities. In my
opinion/experience, this makes for a more complex teaching experience,
more careful planning and a whole different level of responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;criticising-my-own-pedagogy&quot;&gt;Criticising my own pedagogy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have adapted how I test/assess students during the 4 years, 3 course
and 10 semester classes I have taught since I moved to my current
position. Following the Carpentries philosophy, my courses are
hands-on and are based on repeated practice, so that students &lt;em&gt;get it&lt;/em&gt;
and have a chance to apply what they have learnt. As opposed to other
courses, it isn’t quite possible to leave it to the last week(s)
before the exam to cram all the material in short term memory -
students need to attend and practise exercises in class and (ideally
also) at home. To promote students’ work, I organise weekly tests
which, for a couple of years now, allowed those that earned good
marks, to transfer their mean test scores to their final grade, and
thus get a dispense for the exam. Unfortunately, this hasn’t proven as
successful as I had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for the failure of this test/dispense approach is well
known to those that have studied to effect of marking and grading -
the focus of the student is switched from &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; new skills to
obtaining a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; mark. And, as clearly stated by Marcus
Schultz-Bergin in his chapter &lt;em&gt;Grade Anarchy in the Philosophy
Classroom&lt;/em&gt; (p. 175) (from &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;): &lt;strong&gt;Grades do not track learning&lt;/strong&gt; (or
anything else of importance) and, to add insult to injury, &lt;strong&gt;grading
reduces student learning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indeed matches my observation. My students have access to any
material they see fit for the tests and exams. Some focus their
preparation on gathering as much material as possible (such as answers
from previous tests and exercises) and then apply the &lt;em&gt;minimax&lt;/em&gt;
strategy to maximise the marks while minimising their own work by
matching the answers they have gathered to the questions of the
day. The focus of the tests has become the tests’ marks, and most
criticism/feedback at the end of a lesson (I use the Carpentries
famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/21-management/index.html#sticky-notes&quot;&gt;colour sticky
notes&lt;/a&gt;
to increase interactions and collect feedback after each class) was
the lack of time to finish/get good marks, with little questioning
about the understanding/mastering of the material (such as being able
to answer the questions in a limited but doable amount of time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to clarify here that I don’t blame the
students. Students, as a collective entity, will adapt to rules and
constrains that are set to them. Maximising the success in exams is a
natural adaptation to the current system, that has focused on grades
as a mean of standardisation. Even if the goal of this standardisation
is (or was) equality and fairness (in the face of an increasing number
of students), it has led to the acquisition of grades to become the
main (and often only) assessment of successful learning and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ungrading-why-rating-students-undermines-learning&quot;&gt;UNgrading, why rating students undermines learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last summer holidays, I read &lt;em&gt;UNgrading, why rating
students undermines learning (and what to do instead)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a
collection of chapters edited by Susan D. Blum, highlighting the
issues with grading and sharing the experiences of some instructors
that decided to drop them in their classes. To summarise the main
arguments made by the many authors in the book, I’ll cite Marcus
Schultz-Bergin again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grades do not track learning (or anything else of importance).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grading reduces student learning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only receiving feedback (and no grades) increases student learning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-evaluation and self-reflection improve student learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last point refers to the concept of &lt;em&gt;meta-cognition&lt;/em&gt;, thinking
about how we think, and learn, and the ability to self-assess. It is
paramount for students to learn how to receive and use the feedback
they are given. Self-evaluation of one’s own learning process should
be the ultimate goal of any teaching enterprise, as it essentially
provides the means for anyone to learn any new subject they are
interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors provide more details about points 1 and 2 above, but my
own observation made it abundantly clear that, despite my best
intentions, tests offering a possibility to get a dispense for the
exam wasn’t working. I took plenty of notes during my reading of the
ungrading book and have devised alternative approaches that I’m
looking forward to apply this semester. I will drop marking and put as
much emphasis as possible on providing feedback, and leading students
to assess their own work, focusing on understanding and mastering the
material, rather than on obtaining grades. Before I describe my plans,
I must specify that I will have to provide a grade for the end of year
assessment, that students will earn with an exam. Even though I am
convinced that marking isn’t an appropriate assessment of learning, I
will first need to implement this in my classes and assess if/how this
affects student learning and (hopefully) how they perform in that
final exam. There is a long learning curve ahead (for me) and battle
to extend this further. I have exciting plans for my bachelor and
master courses. Read on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-steps-in-ungraded-land&quot;&gt;First steps in ungraded land&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be dropping grades in all the tests that are given throughout
the term (typically at each or most lectures but the first one) in
both bachelor courses. The first implication of this is that there
won’t be any opportunity for students to be dispensed from the final
exam, which is an opportunity several counted on. I will thus need to
make sure that the reasons for this, described above, are clear (see
point 1 below). The goal is to promote self-evaluation, feedback on
their understanding of the material, and a reflection on their
learning process. Instead of grading each individual test (a
time-consuming activity), we will answer test’s questions together, in
class, right after the test itself. This is something I have done
previously, albeit rather swiftly. Here, I intend to take more time
and involve the students as much as possible by asking for their
active participation. After the collaborative correction, I will ask
them to answer a quick poll, assessing whether (1) they understood the
material but need more work to really master it, (2) they mastered the
material and are ready to move on or (3) they neither understood nor
mastered it and will ask for help (see point 2 below). Teaching
assistants (TAs) and myself will spare some considerable time by not
grading tens of copies (sometime over 60) and will seize it to put
this new pedagogical strategy into place. After the poll, students
will be invited to review their work after the lecture, in the light
of the correction and their self-assessment and come to us to ask
specific questions about their work, things they struggled with, or
advice on how they could improve their learning (see point 3
below). The goal of this is to steer away from grades and re-focus on
their understanding/mastering of the material, offer opportunities for
personalised feedback, and promote self-evaluation and
meta-cognition. Fingers crossed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-evaluation works best in an environment where we trust each
other. To emphasise this, I have also decided to change the attendance
formalities. Since the beginning, I have made attendance mandatory. At
my institution and in Belgium in general, attendance is only mandatory
for practicals, and optional for formal lectures. Given that in my
courses, theory and practice blend into each other, that I try to give
as much hands-on work as possible during the classes, and that it is
unlikely to master the material without that practice anyway, presence
was mandatory, and TAs circulated attendance sheet that students had
to sign. I will be honest that I didn’t check them systematically and
didn’t follow up on absences. But I thought that this &lt;em&gt;pressure&lt;/em&gt; would
force students to attend and get them a chance to practise. I decided
to change this. Attendance is still mandatory for the reasons
mentioned above, but I will not use presence sheets anymore. If a
student can’t make it, I’m asking for a short email to let me know
that they aren’t or weren’t able to attend. I do not need any reason
for the absence. I will just ask them to specify, in that email, how
they plan to make up for the missed lesson, including asking me or the
TAs for extra help. I think this approach builds on trust and
self-motivation, invites students to take responsibility for their own
learning, and promotes reflection of their progress, notably when they
miss a class (whatever the reason).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-self-assessments-theirs-and-mine&quot;&gt;First self-assessments (theirs and mine)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how things look like after a couple of weeks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A short live poll (using sticky notes) during the first class of
the year, after explaining the reasons for dropping the dispense
and implementing the new strategy, was seen in a positive light by
the great majority of the students. A handful of the 50 students
regretted not being able to get a dispense. My impression is that
these are the students that were aiming to get one (some of them
probably already got one for the previous course), and consider
this a loss (for them, personally) compared to the opportunities
offered by the change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first post-test polls of the year indicate that the majority of
students understand the material but needed more work to fully
master it (from 55 to 85%). Smaller fractions of students don’t
understand the material and conceded they need more help (8 to 14%)
or fully master it (from 0 to 17%). The proportions are variable,
depending on the chapter, but the fraction of students
understanding the material is always the largest, by a comfortable
margin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We set up office hours during the week and just before the
lectures, making sure that these didn’t conflict with the student
schedule. So far, for the first weeks this has been in place, the
number of students that booked and met with us was not in line with
the poll - we meet with 1 to 3 students per week, out of a total
over 40.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have received a couple of emails from students not being able to
attend. Most were related to clashes in their schedule (for
students that had lectures from second and third bachelor
years). Some of these emails did follow the guideline and explained
how they intended to make up for missing the classes: work by
themselves, use the recordings we provide, interact with class
mates who do attend the lectures. Along the same lines, I had one
student that explicitly wrote that they would revise the sections
they struggled with on their end-of-class red sticky notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adjustments-for-smaller-classes&quot;&gt;Adjustments for smaller classes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The master’s course provides more freedom to experiment further, as
there are less students in the class and allows for more one-to-one
interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, students had to prepare and present two data analysis
reports throughout the semester course, focusing on two different
high-throughput data types (transcriptomics and proteomics). We
devote 3 to 4 successive session to each project: (1) lectures and
exercises for them to learn and practice the theory, (2) a session
where they test what they have learnt on their own data and can ask
questions about the material and their data and (3) a short
presentation with questions from the audience (other students and
instructors), followed by, the following week, the submission of a
detailed report that takes into account the questions and discussion
during the respective presentations. I am considering to let
students choose whether they prefer to do the second project, or
propose improvements and extension to the first project and, if they
wish, implement these during the next practice sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am also considering to ask students to comment on each others
written reports, in addition to the question and answer sessions, to
further emphasise peer assessment and promote
peer/self-evaluation. This could also be a good source of
inspiration for improvements and extension to their first project
(see previous point).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the master course’s oral exam, we focus primarily on the
questions and discussions from the written reports. I systematically
ask what students preferred in the course or felt they have mastered
best, and what they struggled with. I would like to go a step
further and ask them to propose and motivate their marks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ideas-for-the-future&quot;&gt;Ideas for the future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how the attempts above are received and how they
influence the students’ learning, I might consider propose a more
ambitious project to the 3rd bachelor students. This might only really
apply to students that are re-taking the class and thus have already
an overview of the whole material, and are in a position to anticipate
the kind of data, analyses and interpretation that would be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One or a group of students will be able to choose a project they
want to work on throughout the year. Choosing a project would
entail to identify a dataset and one or several questions they want
to address with that data, confirm that the project would be
written up as a (reproducible) report, and, if they work as a
group, some sort of agreement that all members of the group will
contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They have total freedom in the complexity of the data and questions
they choose to work on. It could either be a rather ambitous
project, that would account for all credits/marks of the course, or
choose something smaller. There could be an option to make up for
the rest of the marks with (parts of) the final exam (that those
that didn’t choose a project would have to take anyway), although I
haven’t figured out the details of this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The students and the education team (i.e. TAs and myself) would
discuss their project (data and questions), the feasibility and the
adequacy of their proposal, and the marks they would obtain upon
successful completion. All these are open to discussion and
amendments during the iterations in the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Students and the education team would meet regularly to discuss the
project’s advancement and provide guidance to help them to
successfully reach their goals. These goals and the marks/credits
could be revisited accordingly: an overly ambitous project could be
reduced and, conversely, if the goals are attained earlier than
expected, students could propose extensions if they wish so.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think students should have the freedom to back out whenever they
want to, if at any point they prefer to take the exam. They should
also have the freedom to propose a project that counts for, say 50%
of the marks, and settle with that without taking the exam if they
reach their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The completion of the project would be officialised by the final
submission of the report. Importantly, the education team wouldn’t
read/discover that report for the first time at that point, but
would have followed its progress throughout the year so that, at
the time of submission, little doubts persist as to the successful
completion of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If students worked as a group, they would need to provide a section
describing their respective contributions. Again, these would have
been laid out early on, and possibly updated, throughout the
project. Every student of the group would get the same final mark
but individuals would get recognised for their specific
contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is quite some excitement on my part with these new approaches,
which has, I believe, a positive impact on my teaching. The lectures
seem to have become more interactive: I try to make sure that all/most
students get asked questions about the material we see and the
exercises we do. Based on the sticky notes feedback that are collected
at the end of each lecture, they seem to appreciate it because it
improves their involvement and attention.  In previous years, sampling
students at random for to answer my questions was reported as being
stressful on the sticky notes. It feels like clarifying and
verbalising the goals gives me more freedom to reach out to the
students and them to take it as a genuine learning opportunity. The
latest set of sticky notes goes along these lines and gives hope for
the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading-assessment/&quot;&gt;first ungrading

By then, I had only taught a few workshops, and was very impressed by the content of the training, and by Greg Wilson, who delivered it with touching sincerity and dedication. A couple of years later, I managed to secure some funding from the R Consortium to organise an instructor course in Cambridge, where I worked at the time, and was delighted to be able to revisit the content. The Carpentries approach to lesson design and teaching has stuck with me since then. I have applied these principles and some of the material to my main university courses (WSBIM1207 and WSBIM1322 for the second and third bachelor courses respectively and WSBIM2122 for the master’s course), and am now, as part of the Bioconductor Teaching committee, developing new lessons.</summary></entry></feed>
