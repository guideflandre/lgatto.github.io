Of course, it is only fair to get credit for the time and efforts
researchers invest in reviewing their peers' work. Especially so for
early career researchers. But we should be careful what we wish for!

<!--more-->

First of all, when we say credit, some will hear metrics. Researchers
already endure considerable pressure in reaching an ever increasing
number of metrics in an ever increasing businessification of the
academia. The time and efforts put into peer review mustn't equate to
yet another bean counting exercise and escalation of number games: How
many articles have you reviews? For which journals?

Our reviews and efforts mustn't become yet more data that becomes an
instrument of commercial control over researchers and research
outputs. We have seen where this leads with the many commercial
predators that rule scientific
publishing. [Publons](https://publons.com/about/home/), is a site that
*tracks, verifies, and showcases [their] peer review and editorial
contributions*. While positive on first sight, the company was bought
in 2017 by Clarivate Analytics, the company that manages the infamous
and harmful impact factor.

Finally, and this is by far the most important demand for any sensible
credit for peer reviewing, is the absolute requirement for our peer
review reports to be openly published. Without this, any initiative to
get credit for our work is meaningless and will inexorably lead to a
weaponised metric.

  that highlights some of my points above: "If [...] we turn peer
  review into a mandatory career requirement that is rewarded with
  credit, it changes the nature of the behavior." and "A second
  problem with peer review credit schemes [...] is the increased power
  it places in the hands of publishers and editors."

- [Getting credit for peer
  review](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/02/getting-credit-peer-review),
  from 2016, briefly talks about different platforms to earn peer
  review credits, but completely misses the essential point of open
  peer review.
