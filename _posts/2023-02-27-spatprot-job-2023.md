tags: ["job"]

---

A position for a PhD student (4 years) or a research assistant (1 year
contracts, renewable) is open in the CBIO lab focusing on protein
sub-cellular localisation (spatial) proteomics, post-translational
modification and machine learning.

The goal of the project is to apply and extend existing spatial
proteomics methods (see for example
[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24413670/),
[2](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006516)
and [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33570-9)) and
software infrastructure (such as the
[pRoloc](https://bioconductor.org/packages/pRoloc) package) to focus
more specifically on the detection and the effect of
post-translational modifications in protein and proteoform
sub-cellular localisation.

This position is part of the [FWO](https://www.fwo.be/en/)-funded
Protein Contours project, and is in collaboration with [Win
Vranken](https://we.vub.ac.be/en/wim-vranken) from the VUB and
[Lennart Martens](https://www.compomics.com/people/lennart-martens/)
from Gent University.

The successful candidate will have a degree in bioinformatics,
statistics, computer sciences, biomedical sciences, or equivalent and
be able to demonstrate experience and/or keen interest in at least
several of the following:

- experience in one or multiple omics experimental technologies, data
  processing, analysis and/or interpretation - experience in mass
  spectrometry and proteomics is an advantage;
- a keen interest in understanding and tackling biomedically relevant
  questions;
- interest in robust method development;
- background/expertise in statistics, machine learning and/or
  artificial intelligence;
- open and reproducible research (e.g. Rmarkdown, Jupyter notebooks,
  Github, version control, ...);
- experience in R/Bioconductor data structures, in particular those
  used for omics data analysis (e.g. SummarizedExperiment,
  SingleCellExeriment, QFeatures, ...);
- contribution to an open and inclusive research environment;
- good written and oral communication skills.

## About the CBIO lab

The Computational Biology and Bioinformatics lab is headed by Prof
[Laurent Gatto](https://lgatto.github.io/about) and is composed of
students and researchers with expertise in biomedical sciences,
statistics, omics data analysis and bioinformatics. Details about our
work and the members can be found at
https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/.

The lab supports a friendly and supportive work environment through
flexible working hours and the possibility to work remotely. The lab
meetings are typically scheduled in-person (or mixed remote/in-person)
to favour interactions among lab members. While joining the lab and
contribution to our research, you will also have the opportunity to get
involved in the international Bioconductor community. The lab members
have opportunities to join courses and conferences in Belgium and
abroad to present their work.

## Academic environment

The [de Duve Institute](https://www.deduveinstitute.be/) is a
multidisciplinary biomedical research institute (250-300 scientists)
hosting several laboratories the UCLouvain, as well as the Brussels
branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. The focus is on
basic research in the fields of tumour immunology and signal
transduction in cancer, genetics and development, including human
genetics, stem cells and organ development, infection and inflammation
and metabolism and hormones. The de Duve Institute also features
several core facilities, including imaging, transgenesis, mass
spectrometry, flow cytometry and cell sorting, as well as
genomics. The de Duve Institute provides access to a high-performance
computing cluster and storage, managed by a dedicated IT team.

## Application

To apply for the position, please send the following documents to
Laurent Gatto:

- A cover letter describing why you would like to join the lab and how
  you match the requirement;
- A detailed CV including some or all of the following: a list of
  publications, pre-prints, posters and/or software contributions; a
  link to publicly available code/data analysis you have contributed
  to; education and professional experience; awards; teaching
  experience; any additional information you deem relevant.
- If no code is publicly available, please include code chunks that
  illustrate best your programming experience and interests.
- Among your projects, select 1 and provide a short narrative
  describing why these are important in your career, your specific
  contributions and/or the unique skills you have gained through
  these.
- A list of at least 2 academic references.
