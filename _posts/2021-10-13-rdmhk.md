In this interactive talk at the Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology [Research Data Management Symposium
2021](https://library.ust.hk/events/conferences/rdm-symposium-2021/),
**Laurent Gatto** and **Marta Teperek** will join forces to offer some
concrete examples on improving research reproducibility and
transparency. Laurent will speak from his own perspective as a
researcher and will share some tips and tricks on how one can become a
better scientist by applying open and reproducible research
practices. Marta will speak from the perspective of support staff and
will offer several examples of how institutions can partner with
researchers to help make research more reproducible and more
transparent.

In our talk we will cover aspects such as people support, policies,
training, rewards and community building. The common theme will be
collaboration and partnership between researchers and support staff.

We promise a lot of concrete examples and interaction, and plenty of
time for questions!

## What it's really about

The actual title of this talk comes in two parts:

> **Becoming a better scientist with open and reproducible research
> and supporting the scientist on this journey.**

and

> **Or... the importance of collaboration between researchers and
> support staff for sustainable open and reproducible research
> practices.**

The goal is to have a joint seminar, is to mix some of Laurent's
experiences as an open researcher/teacher and Marta's experience from
TU Delft in providing the support to help researchers achieve these
goals. We hope that by doing this we would appeal to both researchers
and to support staff in the audience:

- Researchers will get some tangible examples from Laurent's
  experience.
- Support staff can see how to best support researchers with making
  their research more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
  Re-usable (FAIR).

Parts of this post are based on previous Laurent's notes/talks from
talks on Becoming a better scientist with open and reproducible
research from [May 2019](https://lgatto.github.io/rr-publ/) and [Dec
2020](https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-rr-2/).

## Who's here?

**Speakers**: we are Dr Marta Teperek (Head of Research Data Services
at TU Delft Library and Director of 4TU.ResearchData, The Netherlands)
and Prof Laurent Gatto (Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Unit,
de Duve Institute, UCLouvain, Belgium)

**Audience**: a week or so before the seminar, we had 158 registered
attendees. Out of which 114 are research postgraduate students, 26 are
HKUST staff/faculty, and 9 are guest participants (librarians from
other HK universities).  The break-down of HKUST participants' school
affiliations gives: Science: 48 (32%), Business: 13 (9%), Admin
offices (library, research office): 12 (8%), Humanities and Social
Sciences: 19 (12%) and Engineering: 59 (39%).

## How it all started

> From 2010 in Cambridge to 2021 in Hong Kong (virtually).

In 2010 Laurent was doing his postdoc in the Department of
Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge. At the same time, Marta
was doing her PhD at the Gurdon Institute, also in Cambridge. We were
literally next door neighbours, worked on similar types of research
(in fact Marta even collaborated with Laurent's group on some
proteomics analysis) and yet we have only met each other properly in
2016 when our shared passion for open and reproducible research
practice allowed us to connect in context of the Data Champions
initiative. Laurent was then a Data Champion, and Marta part of the
Research Data Services at Cambridge.

## What is ‘Open', ‘Reproducible' and ‘Good' science?

- **Poll**: Do you practice open and/or reproducible research?

![Do you practice open and/or reproducible research?](/images/rdmhk-wooclap1.png)


- **Wordcloud**: Ask for a couple of words describing how participants
  see open/reproducible research and create a word cloud?

![Describe open/reproducible research?](/images/rdmhk-wooclap2.png)

### Laurent

We can start with a definition:

> Open science/research is the process of transparent dissemination
> and access to knowledge, that can be applied to various scientific
> practices: open data, open source, open access, …

and

> Reproducible research: there exist several levels, of increasing
> difficulty, that describe the action of using external
> data/software/material/informations to attempt to observe the same
> or comparable results. Formally, we [repeat, reproduce, replicate or
> re-use](https://lgatto.github.io/rr-what-should-be-our-goals/)
> depending on how much of the original material we have access to.


What I dislike about the previous open science/research definition is
that it can give the misleading impression that open research is about
collecting badges, and that the more badges you possess, the better an
open researcher you are. And reciprocally, not having any badge to
display excludes one from being an open researcher. And as soon as
people start to believe this, we will stop practicing open research
and will start doing stamp collection.

Also, Open science/research can mean different things to different
people, in particular when declined along its many technical,
administrative, legal and philosophical attributes.

An important word above is **excludes**: as thriving open researchers,
we need to understand that it isn't only the distance towards
better/open research that we have travelled that is relevant, but that
the starting point matters a lot. The way somebody practices open
research, whether that person has the possibility to implement this or
that open (and reproducible) research practice, or whether they can be
vocal about it mostly depends on their environment and the support or
push back they get.

Embrace open and reproducible research to the extent you want and you
can. Seek allies and support around you, but do not feel pressured. It
isn't open or closed. It is certainly not the same open or close for
everybody.

So my very first take-home messages are:

> Open and reproducible aren't binary, they are gradients,
> multidisciplinary and multidimensional.

How to be an open scientist and implement RR:

> Let's be open and understanding of different situations and
> constraints, including our own.

And also:

> Open != reproducible

> Open != good (by default)

> Reproducible != good (by default)

Open research and reproducible research aren't the same thing, and one
doesn't imply the other. Even though in our modern understanding of
these terms and concepts, they are intimately linked, historically,
they are very different. And research being open or reproducible
doesn't make it good (whatever the definition of good).

But open and reproducible research are **supported by good data
management** (the topic of this talk/post) and lead to **trust,
verification and guarantees**:

- Trust in Reporting - result is accurately reported
- Trust in Implementation - analysis code successfully implements
  chosen methods
- Statistical Trust - data and methods are (still) appropriate
- Scientific Trust - result convincingly supports claim(s) about
  underlying systems or truths

which are a hallmark of good research.

Reproducibility](https://gmbecker.github.io/MayInstituteKeynote2019/outline.html),

## People support

### Laurent

Working openly and reproducibly is paramount for my own and my close
collaborators/students' benefit. Hence, it was natural for me, when
starting my research group, to center the lab's activities around the
**principles of good data management** to enable open and reproducible
research that you can trust.

This is reflected in the CBIO [lab
statement](https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/):

> Open Science and Reproducible Research We are committed to the open,
> transparent and rigorous practice of scientific enquiry. In
> particular, we make every possible effort to make our research
> repeatable, reproducible and replicable, in the hope that it can be
> re-used and improved upon by as many as possible. Concomitantly, we
> release all our software and data under open permissible
> licences. Finally, we will also ensure that our research (such as,
> but not limited to journals articles, presentations, and book
> chapters) is published under open access licences to allow everybody
> to freely read, re-use and mine it.

### Marta

To a lot of researchers the effort, but also the skills needed to
effectively manage their research data and software might be
insurmountable barriers. And the truth is that we should not be
expecting researchers to be excellent at everything: doing research,
applying for grants, managing people, writing papers, teaching,
managing research data and software. [Science should be more about
teamwork, not about heroic efforts of
individuals](https://issues.org/say-goodbye-hero-model-science-elkins-tanton-kavli/). And
working as a team and bringing different types of expertise together,
teams can be much more efficient at answering the big and challenging
questions. So researchers need to be supported by skilled
professionals.

At TU Delft we have two main groups of colleagues who provide
researchers with dedicated support for data and software management:

- **Data stewards** - at TU Delft we have one data steward at every
  faculty. Each faculty specialises in its own area of research and
  data steward provide expert advice in this research area. They are
  not only the go to people for researchers who need support with data
  management, but they also advise the faculties on policies, provide
  training and raise awareness about data management and reproducible
  research within the research community.

- **Digital Competence Centre Support team** - this team consists of a
  central pool of data managers and research software
  engineers. Members of this team provide hands-on support to research
  groups. They teach researchers skills necessary to make their data
  and software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)
  by working with them on their data and software. They help
  researchers create effective data management pipelines, make
  datasets more interoperable, introduce entire teams to version
  control for data and code, improve the quality and sustainability of
  their research software. Researchers apply to receive their support
  and if such applications are granted (competitive process), team
  members join their research groups for up to 2 days per week and up
  to 6 months.

All of these colleagues have research experience and most have a PhD
degree.

And dedicated people are also essential to support infrastructure - to
be the human side of it. At TU Delft we also make use of
[4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/), which is a data and
code repository shared between four technical universities in the
Netherlands. It provides all the state-of-the-art functionalities,
such as DOIs for data, long-term preservation, versioning, Git
integration, but what makes the biggest difference to the researchers
is the dedicated support of our data curators.


## Practice and policy

- **Poll**: Does your institution have policies in place on data management?


![Does your institution have policies in place on data management?](/images/rdmhk-wooclap3.png)

### Laurent

Here's an example of practice from my research:

![qsep screenshots](/images/rr-delft-qsep.png)

From left to right, we have an example of practice of open and reproducible research:

- A [reproducible
  document](https://github.com/lgatto/QSep-manuscript), produced with
  [open source
  software](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pRoloc.html)
  and [curated
  data](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/pRolocdata.html),
- a [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/377630) and
- a [peer reviewer paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2018.11.015).

But one might ask: does it take more time to work reproducibly?

**No**, it is a matter of relocating time!

![Reproducibility relocates time](/images/reproducibiity_relocates_time.png)

From [Five things about open and reproducible science that every early
career researcher should know](https://osf.io/2jt9u/).

From personal experience, I can say that policies aren't the main
motivation to practice good data management. It is important for data
management to be an **intrinsic motivation**, which can (or should)
easily be triggered by the desire to produce **trusted
research**.

Local action at a lab's level and/or at the initiative of one or a few
motivated researchers (early career researchers and faculty) is
possible, easy and efficient. However, it is extremely difficult to
expand outside of one's direct environment. For this, policies are
important.

### Marta

If policies are introduced top-down and just for the sake of having
them in place (compliance reasons or ways for research institutions to
demonstrate they care about the good practice), there is indeed a high
risk that they would turn into a box-ticking exercise. Or worse, they
turn into meaningless documents with the majority of people they are
supposed to apply to, not even aware they exist.

On the other hand, if policies are introduced through consultations
with the community and if they go hand-in-hand with practice, they can
become powerful tools for driving cultural change more widely, at the
institutional level. At TU Delft we have a separate [set of policies
(!) for research data management and a recently introduced policy and
guidelines for research
software](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/policies/tu-delft-faculty-policies).

Our data policy consists of a framework policy which sets out the
basic roles and responsibilities for everyone at TU Delft: from every
researcher, through deans, support staff, and all the way to the
rectorate. Faculties developed their own data policies, based on the
framework policy, where they provide disciplinary specific
interpretations of the framework.

It took years of consultations with all the stakeholders at TU Delft
to arrive at a policy text with which everyone was happy with, as well
as with concrete roles and responsibilities. Interestingly,
researchers were sometimes the main drivers for strict policies. For
example, some of the professors were really concerned about PhD
students leaving TU Delft with all the data, or leaving messy data
behind. Hence, they were very keen on introducing a data management
plan as a compulsory deliverable for PhD students during their first
year Viva (go/no go assessment) and also to ensure that they upload
their data to a repository before graduation.

These two actions are drivers to better data management. Since the
introduction of the policy we have seen huge demand for training on
data management, but also keep hearing from PhD students who say that
they managed to introduce their supervisors and sometimes their entire
research teams to better data management practices.

Another example is [TU Delft's Research Software
Policy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4629662). That's another policy
which took years to develop and implement and one which was driven by
a researcher who was fed up with TU Delft's copyright stance. TU
Delft's official stance on copyright, probably the same as of most
research institutions, was largely that TU Delft owns copyright on
software produced by TU Delft researchers, and if researchers wished
to publish software, they needed to ask TU Delft for a written
permission through filing an invention disclosure form. A lot of
unnecessary bureaucracy, frustrating for everyone.

Under the new software policy, researchers who wish to publish their
research software under open licences, are automatically allowed to do
so and TU Delft transfers copyright to them. This not only hugely
reduces the administrative burden on everyone, but also promotes open
source software practices across the entire institution.

## Training

- **Poll**: have you had any dedicated training on data management and
  reproducible research?

![Have you had any dedicated training on data management?](/images/rdmhk-wooclap4.png)

### Laurent

I started as a Carpentries instructor and now apply these lessons and
best practices in my university courses (bachelor and masters in
biomedical sciences (for example [here](http://bit.ly/WSBIM1207),
[here](http://bit.ly/WSBIM1322) and [here]((http://bit.ly/WSBIM2122)))
and teaching these in workshops for graduate students and ECR.

Teaching data management, open and reproducible research principles
when running a lab is ideal to host students that are well trained in
RDM and RR are readily up to speed to start their research.

### Marta

I wholeheartedly believe that it is essential that adequate training
is available to support researchers in managing their data and
software. While researchers should not need to do everything on their
own (there is also the need for people support), having a solid
background in data management and software management skills is often
essential to properly benefit from such support and to make sure it
leads to long-term benefits by becoming embedded in the researchers'
workflows and practices.

At TU Delft our Data Managers and Research Software Engineers
regularly receive requests for hands-on support. But often for these
technical experts to even get started, it is essential to establish a
common understanding with the research team about what needs to be
done and how to do it best. For this to happen, they need to speak the
same language. Solid software and data management skills are essential
to do efficient and effective research and to save a lot of time and
money.

As nicely articulated in the recent [OECD report *Building Digital
Workforce Capacity and Skills for Data-intensive
Science*](https://doi.org/10.1787/e08aa3bb-en):

> Academic libraries (...) are a natural focus for digital skills
> support and capacity building (...). [They] train others in data and
> software practices, particularly in relation to foundational skills
> and data stewardship.(...)...Libraries can be an important resource
> for universities to increase their digital workforce capacities,
> provided that the necessary investment is made.

At TU Delft we have developed a shared vision on what kind of data and
software management training should be provided to our
researchers. The [vision was published in
2019](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3516874). Since then we have been
working hard to implement this vision. Feedback we have been receiving
on our courses has been really good and emphasised the need for
training. However, we have already hit a capacity gap. Our supply for
training is unable to meet the demand. So, as the OECD report stated,
investment is necessary.

But as Laurent said, the Carpentries are an excellent example of where
collaboration between support staff and researchers is essential. To
deliver the Carpentries, the Library provides the framework, pays for
the membership, organises instructor training and coordinates the
organisations. The courses themselves are delivered by a community of
instructors, consisting of data stewards and researchers. Software
Carpentry workshops are typically discipline-agnostic, but to delivery
discipline-specific data carpentries, such as the Genomic Data
Carpentry or Data Carpentry for Social Sciences, it is essential to
partner with researchers who work on these types of data.

## Rewards

- **Wordcloud**: What would motivate you towards being more open/RR?
  More citations, better chances of getting hired, ...

![What would motivate you towards being more open/RR?](/images/rdmhk-wooclap5.png)

### Laurent

**Benefits for your academic career**: [How open science helps
researchers
succeed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4973366/) and
more examples from the [Open as a career
boost](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4973366/)
paragraph:

- Open access articles get more citations.
- Open publications get more media coverage.
- Data availability is associated with citation benefit.
- Openly available software is more likely to be used. (I don't have
  any reference for this, and there are of course many
  couterexamples).
- Benefit from institutional support of open research practices

**Networking opportunities** (this talk here today)

See also [Why Open Research](http://whyopenresearch.org/index)

- Increase your visibility: Build a name for yourself. Share your work
  and make it more visible.
- Reduce publishing costs: Open publishing can cost the same or less
  than traditional publishing.
- Take back control: Know your rights. Keep your rights. Decide how
  your work is used
- Publish where you want: Publish in the journal of your choice and
  archive an open copy. (See The cost of knowledge boycott of
  Elsevier).
- Get more funding: Meet funder requirements, and qualify for special
  funds such as the Wellcome Trust Open Research Fund.
- Get that promotion: Open research is increasingly recognised in
  promotion and tenure. See also Reproducibility and open science are
  starting to matter in tenure and promotion July 14th, 2017, Brian
  Nosek) and the EU's Evaluation of Research Careers fully
  acknowledging Open Science Practice defines an Open Science Career
  Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM).

**And of course the [Five selfish reasons to work
reproducibly!](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7).**

### Marta

There are also changes happening in the reward and recognition of
researchers at institutional, national and international
levels. Internationally, DORA has been the agent of change. There
seems to be the moment growing recognising that publications and
impact factors aren't suitable indicators of research quality or
impact and that publication pressure can have serious adverse
effects. More and more organisations want to discourage the use of
impact factors in research evaluation. [DORA will develop a dashboard
tracking hiring and promotion criteria across the
institutions](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02145-x). Funders are
also taking important steps forward. For example, the Wellcome Trust
in the UK has been awarding dedicated [funds for Open Research since
2018](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/open-research-fund).
NWO, the main Dutch science funder not only has been awarding funding
to open science and reproducible research, but also introduced
‘narrative CVs' for researchers who apply for grants. Institutions
also become increasingly pro-active at recognising that change in
recognition and rewards is necessary.

But in my opinion the most important changes are the ones done by
individuals. Everyone matters, everyone can contribute to making a
difference. When I think about the work that Laurent does… he now has
two Master students in his lab who got inspired by his practice and
wanted to do projects with him. We can all lead by example and should
continue doing this.

Here we should also remember that recognition also means recognising
the crucial work of support staff, who are often important drivers for
Open Science and Reproducible Research practice. The work of data
managers, data stewards, research software engineers, community
managers, librarians is sometimes not visible, but it is essential and
should be recognised as such. Here we would also like to thank the
organisers for bringing us all together today and facilitating today's
discussion on open and reproducible research practices.

## Community

Community, peer support and meeting great people. Open not only as in
sharing, but as inclusive and welcoming. ♥

And since 2010, Marta and Laurent still work together :-)

### Marta

I fully agree with Laurent about the impact and importance of
communities. In many universities there are now Data Champions, Data
Ambassadors, Open Science or Open Research Communities… So join one if
you have one! And if you don't have one, no problem. These communities
are bottom up. This means you can simply start from meeting for a
coffee with a like-minded colleague or two. That's how Laurent and
colleagues have started the OpenConCambridge back then. Entirely
bottom-up. You don't need to wait for someone else to get started. Any
opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals sharing your
thoughts and curiosity about open science and reproducible working
practices is a great opportunity. And who knows, maybe this webinar
will be your chance to get started?

And to give you some concrete benefit... The journey that Laurent and I
had together started in 2010. Now, in 2021, virtually in Honk-Kong we
are still friends and we now we will always support one another and
can rely on each other. Also when preparing this seminar.
