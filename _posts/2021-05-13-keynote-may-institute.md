These are my notes for my
[talk](https://lgatto.github.io/2021_05_13_MayInstitute/) at the 2021
edition of the May Institute in Computation and statistics for mass
spectrometry and proteomics.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to start by thanking the [May
Institute](https://computationalproteomics.khoury.northeastern.edu/)
organisers for the invitation, and for organising such an event. The
reasons why I think their efforts are so valuable should become
apparent below. For now, suffice to say that I believe that it is
essential for researchers to be able to question their data without
constrains - and we need the tools and the skills to be able to do
that. The May Institute is one place where we can acquire or improve
these skills.

## Motivation

**Inverse problems** are hard!

Example and figure borrowed from [Stephen Eglen](https://sje30.github.io/talks/2017/cam_eglen.html#inverse-problems-are-hard).

| Score (%) | grade |
|:---------:|:-----:|
| 70-100    |    A  |

- **Forward problem**: I scored 68, what was my grade?

- **Inverse problem**: I got a B, what was my score?

**Research sharing**: the inverse problem

Where is the scholarship?


> An article about computational science in a scientific publication

> development environment and that complete set of instructions that

## Why reproducibility is important

For **scientific reasons**: think reproducibility crisis (discussed
below).

For **political reasons**: public trust in science, in data, in
experts; without (public) trust in science and research, there won't
be any funding anymore; lack of (public) trust in science leads to
poor public health decisions!


## Reliable research

It's not about reprodcible research.

It's not about open research.

It's about **reliable** research! It's about **trust** -- openness and
reproducibility are means that (should) lead to greater trust in the
data, analyses and results.

## Is there a cost?

Well, **yes**, probably ... there's no such thing as a free lunch.

But

- the cost is worth it IMHO
- cost is mostly time, (in most cases) not $.
- with the right tools and skills, these costs can be minimised
- and it requires **discipline**.

Actually **no**, it is a matter or relocating time!

From [Five things about open and reproducible science that every early
career researcher should know](https://osf.io/2jt9u/).

## But what do we mean by reproducibility?

From a [*But what to we mean by
reproducibility?*](https://lgatto.github.io/rr-what-should-be-our-goals/)
blog post.

- **Repeat** my experiment, i.e. obtain the same tables/graphs/results
  using the same setup (data, software, ...) in the same lab or on the
  same computer. That's basically re-running one of my analysis some
  time after I original developed it.

- **Reproduce** an experiment (not mine), i.e. obtain the same
  tables/graphs/results in a different lab or on a different computer,
  using the same setup (the data would be downloaded from a public
  repository and the same software, but possibly different version,
  different OS, is used). I suppose, we should differentiate
  replication using a fresh install and a virtual machine or docker
  image that replicates the original setup.

- **Replicate** an experiment, i.e. obtain the same (similar enough)
  tables/graphs/results in a different set up. The data could still be
  downloaded from the public repository, or possibly
  re-generate/re-simulate it, and the analysis would be re-implemented
  based on the original description. This requires openness, and one
  would clearly not be allowed the use a black box approach (VM,
  docker image) or just re-running a script.

- Finally, **re-use** the information/knowledge from one experiment to
  run a different experiment with the aim to confirm results from
  scratch.

Another view (from a talk by [Kirstie
Whitaker](https://figshare.com/articles/Publishing_a_reproducible_paper/4720996/1)):

|                    | Same Data | Different Data |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Same Code**      | reproduce | replicate      |
| **Different Code** | robust    | generalisable  |


See also this opinion piece by Jeffrey T. Leek and Roger D. Peng,
[*Reproducible research can still be wrong: Adopting a prevention
approach*](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/6/1645).


Whether you want to

- repeat the analysis you just did yesterday;
- reproduce some old code on the same or different data;
- improve your code using existing data;
- replicate someone else's analysis using their data (but your code/software); or
- generate new data to verify/validate the scientific
  validity/replicability of a study

in my opinion, it all boils down to **understanding** what has been
done and what is happening.

I am not (that much) interested in blindly re-running something to
confirm that I can the same results without understanding it. However,
it is important to acknowledge that even simply repeating or
reproducing a complex analysis isn't trivial - especially for very
large data, large compute requirement, dedicate hardware, long
simulation times, ...

Note that sometimes, things are expected not the reproduce, for
example when bugs are fixed, analysis methods are
changed/improved. This brings us back to the importance of
understanding what we do and why we do it.

## Why reproducibility is important (as an individual researcher)

**(Computational) Reproducibility Is Not The Point**

Take home message:

> The goal is **trust**, **verification** and **guarantees**:

- **Trust in Reporting** - result is accurately reported
- **Trust in Implementation** - analysis code successfully implements
  chosen methods
- **Statistical Trust** - data and methods are (still) appropriate
- **Scientific Trust** - result convincingly supports claim(s) about
  underlying systems or truths

Take home message:

> Reproducibility isn't binary, it's a gradient, it's multidisciplinary, it's multidimensional.

Another take home message:

> Reproducibility isn't easy.

## More reasons to become a reproducible research practitioner

> And so, my fellow scientists: ask not what you can do for

> present five reasons why working reproducibly pays off in the long
> run and is in the self-interest of every ambitious, career-oriented
> scientist.

1. **Reproducibility helps to avoid disaster**: a project is more than
   a beautiful result. You need to record in detail how you got
   there. Starting to work reproducibly early on will save you time
   later. I had cases where a collaborator told me they preferred the
   results on the very first plots they received, that I couldn't
   recover a couple of month later. But because my work was
   reproducible and I had tracked it over time (using git and GitHub),
   I was able, after a little bit of data analysis forensics, to
   identify why these first, preliminary plots weren't consistent with
   later results (and it as a simple, but very relevant bug in the
   code). Imagine if my collaborators had just used these first plots
   for publication, or to decide to perform further experiments.
2. **Reproducibility makes it easier to write papers**: Transparency
   in your analysis makes writing papers much easier. In dynamic
   documents (using
   [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/),
   [juypter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and other similar tools),
   all results are automatically update when the data are changed. You
   can be confident your numbers, figures and tables are up-to-date.
3. **Reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way**: a reproducible
   document will tick many of the boxes enumerated above. You will
   make me very happy reviewer if I can review a paper that is
   reproducible.
4. **Reproducibility enables continuity of your work:** quoting
   Florian, "In my own group, I don't even discuss results with
   students if they are not documented well. No proof of
   reproducibility, no result!".
5. **Reproducibility helps to build your reputation:** publishing
   reproducible research will build you the reputation of being an
   honest and careful researcher. In addition, should there ever be a
   problem with a paper, a reproducible analysis will allow to track
   the error and show that you reported everything in good faith.

# Tools for reproducible research

- R/Bioconductor -- many of you are familiar or even experts with R.
- Writing R scripts (could also be Rmd files) to keep track of what we
  do, and be able to easily re-run the code.

Here (i.e. as part of the May Institute), I took the decision to let
you install the packages on your computers. Many of you will have
taken the R classes, so you should have a working installation and
good to go.

Another approach could have been to prepare Docker container or Amazon
Machine Image with all pre-installed software and data (Bioconductor
provides [Docker containers](http://bioconductor.org/help/docker/) and
[AMIs](http://bioconductor.org/help/bioconductor-cloud-ami/)). Bioconductor
uses the *Orchestra* platform for conference workshops. I use the
[Renku](https://renkulab.io/) environment for my university
teaching. After installing docker on your computer or running an
[pre-configured online
environment](https://renkulab.io/projects/laurent.gatto/wsbim-bioinfo),
you would *simply* download and run that container. This is
particularly relevant for complex installations.

In my experience, the installation of R and R/Bioconductor packages is
relatively straighforward (and a useful experience) to be done by hand
by researchers that want to analyse their own data.

The aim of the R for Mass Spectrometry initiative is to provide
efficient, thoroughly documented, tested and flexible R software for
the analysis and interpretation of high throughput mass spectrometry
assays, including proteomics and metabolomics experiments. The project
formalises the longtime collaborative development efforts of its core
members under the R for Mass Spectrometry organisation to facilitate
dissemination and accessibility of their work.

[QFeatures](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/articles/QFeatures.html)
package.


1. Package installation
2. Downloading data
3. Make an experiment, adding files, possible other metadata (pmid,
   doi)
4. create raw data object
5. load identification data
6. filter id data
7. join spectra and id data
8. Add them to the experiment
9. Optionally also add id data
10. Extract subset of interest
11. Change backend
12. Cluster spectra
13. Visualise data
