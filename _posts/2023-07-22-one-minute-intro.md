Every now and then, there's a situation where I need to briefly
introduce myself, academically. This can be with or without any visual
support (i.e a slide). Instead of doing so semi-randomly, I though I
would prepare such a one-minute introduction, once an for all. So here
I go, with a nice illustrative [heck-sticker
slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R3W63-TdOJcjSs8p_QnTQ7iC7IsJnuwOe1EBb7thfTE/edit?usp=sharing)
and plenty of links.

- I am [Laurent Gatto](http://lgatto.github.io/about), professor of
  bioinformatics at the [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/). I teach
  (more of my courses) at the [Faculty of pharmacy and biomedical
  sciences](https://uclouvain.be/fr/facultes/fasb) and run a
  computation biology lab at the [de Duve
  institute](https://www.deduveinstitute.be/).

- The [lab](https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/)'s research focuses on
  developing statistical and machine learning methods to process,
  explore and comprehend high-dimensional biological data, such as
  typically produces by omics technologies. Working on the university
  biomedical campus, we deploy our work on clinically and biomedically
  relevant research projects, in collaboration with other laboratories
  on the campus.

- I am committed to the open, transparent and rigorous practice of
  scientific enquiry. In particular, we make every possible effort to
  make our [research repeatable, reproducible and
  replicable](http://lgatto.github.io/rr-what-should-be-our-goals/).

- The development and publication of scientific software (see
  [here](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/),
  [here](https://github.com/lgatto) and
  [here](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/)) is an integral
  part of my work and is reflected by my contributions to the
  [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) project.

- I also serve on the Bioconductor [technical advisory
  board](https://bioconductor.org/about/technical-advisory-board/),
  [European Bioconductor
  Society](https://bioconductor.org/about/european-bioconductor-society/),
  [education and teaching
  committee](https://bioconductor.org/help/education-training/) and
  the [Code of conduct
  committee](https://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/) and
  co-organise the yearly European [EuroBioc
  conference](https://eurobioc2023.bioconductor.org/).
