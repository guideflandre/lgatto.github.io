The HUPO Early Career Researcher (ECR) committee has organised a
discussion panel on *Getting recognised for your work* and have asked
my to participate - thank you! I am always keen on such events,
organised by and for ECRs.

The first part of the panel is a short 5-minute introduction of the
panellists, including [Prof Stacy
Malaker](https://www.malakerlab.com/) from Yale University and [Dr
Juan Antonio
Vizcaino](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/people/person/juan-vizcaino/) from the
EMBL-EBI.

I prepared this career flow chart as a visual aid:

![Career path](/images/2024-ecr-recognition-careerpath.png)

- I earned my PhD in 2006, from the [Free University of
  Brussels](https://www.ulb.be/) (ULB). My PhD work focused on the
  evaluation of different types of evolutionary genetic markers to
  study cetaceans phylogeny.
- During my PhD (probably around 2004 or so), when my work and
  interests shifted toward bioinformatics, I started a part-time
  degree in computer science at the [University of
  Namur](https://unamur.be/) (previously called FacultÃ©s
  universitaires Notre-Dame-de-la-Paix - FUNDP). That lasted until I
  left Belgium for the UK in 2010, after completing all my exams, but
  before finishing my masters project - I never graduated.
- After my PhD, I worked for 3 years in industry. I didn't see much
  point in continuing in academia at that point, considering my
  experience so far and my personal situation. The environment and
  general atmosphere was very much like an academic lab, with many
  more collaborations then what I had experienced so far, and clear
  and common objectives. This goal-oriented work environment was a
  very refreshing experience that has been influential for the next
  steps of my career. At some point, I felt I was starting to run in
  circles and got a chance to move back to academia, at the
  [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) nonetheless.
- In 2010, I started a post-doctoral research associate (PDRA)
  position in the [Cambridge Centre for
  Proteomics](https://proteomics.bio.cam.ac.uk/), working on mass
  spectrometry-based proteomics.
- In 2013, I got promoted to senior research associate (SRA), which
  allowed me to earn some grants as main PI and develop a small
  research team.
- In 2018, I joined the
  [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html) as a professor of
  bioinformatics. I teach in the [faculty of pharmacy and biomedical
  sciences](https://uclouvain.be/fr/facultes/fasb) and run the CBIO
  [computational research group](https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/)
  in the [de Duve Institute](https://www.deduveinstitute.be/).

An interesting fact is that I started working on DNA during my PhD,
moved on with RNA in the private company, and since moving back to
academia, I have been focusing on proteins: my career followed the
main path of the [central dogma of molecular
biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology).

To give more context to my career path, I also highlight some other
activities and interests, that have been instrumental for me. I
started to realise the importance of open and reproducible research
around 2010, both with respect to the rigour of doing research, but
also in the light of the (at times) [oppressive and restrictive global
research environment](http://bulliedintobadscience.org/) ECR have to
endure. The desire for others to benefit from my research by making it
as open, collaborative and reproducible as possible, and being quite
[vocal about it](https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-rr-2/), has
followed me since then.

The [Bioconductor project](https://bioconductor.org/) has also been
instrumental for me. It has allowed me over the years to meet and be
by influenced outstanding scientists, and has offered an international
environment in which I was able to grow and flourish. I published my
first (now retired) [Bioconductor
package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.12/bioc/html/yaqcaffy.html)
around 2007 (Bioconductor 2.2 and R 2.7), and many more followed. I am
a Bioconductor package reviewer, a member of the EuroBioc conference
organisation committee (I was a local organiser for a handful EuroBioc
conferences in Cambridge, in 2019 in Brussels, and in [2023 in
Ghent](https://eurobioc2023.bioconductor.org/)), have been part until
recently of the [Code of
Conduct](https://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/) committee,
am part of the social media working group, I co-lead the [Teaching
committee](https://bioconductor.org/help/education-training/), am
since 2018 member of the [Technical Advisory
Board](https://bioconductor.org/about/technical-advisory-board/), and
co-created, in 2021, the [European Bioconductor
Society](https://bioconductor.org/about/european-bioconductor-society/).

The panellists were also asked to comment on how we have been
recognised for our work, with a particular emphasis our time as
ECRs. This is of course very subjective, and I'm not sure if my answer
will reflect how I have been recognised (assuming I have), or how I
hope I have been. I will also try to look beyond papers, the obvious
academic outputs - without those, there is little chance to get
academic recognition. This is of course a major problem, as there's
much more to research than papers:

> An article about computational science in a scientific publication
> is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the
> scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software
> development environment and that complete set of instructions that
> generated the figures.

[Buckheit and Donoho 1995, after Claerbout]

I think I'm know for the computational development and applications in
spatial (2010...) and single-cell proteomics (2018...), my efforts to
produce open and reproducible research, open and collaborative
software, my R/Bioconductor contributions (some packages have been
around for since 2010) as well as my involvement in teaching, such as
international workshops (for example the mythical - for me at least -
Bioconductor [CSAMA course](https://csama2024.bioconductor.eu/)).

One noteworthy aspect of my publication strategy is the workflow that
typically starts with the release of the software (more often than not
after review, on Bioconductor), then the publication of a pre-print
with code to reproduce the analyses and, eventually, a peer-reviewed
paper.

![open software, pre-print and paper publication workflow](/images/2024-ecr-recognition-pubworkflow.png)

I think I have gained some reputation as having acquired some
expertise in my computational quantitative proteomics, including
demonstrable *technical skills*, in addition to more standard
*scientific/academic output*.


In terms of recognition, I suppose that invitations to give talks
(science), teach at workshops (pedagogical and technical skills) and
to submit papers are obvious goals. Being recognised for my open and
collaborative contributions with a [Bioconductor community
award](https://bioconductor.org/about/awards/) is one of my proudest
moments. High on the list are also the
[many](https://lgatto.github.io/msnbase-contribs/)
[contributions](https://lgatto.github.io/msnbase-contribs-2/) that the
[MSnbase](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html)
benefited from - some of these indirectly initiated the
collaborations that lead to the creation of the [R for Mass
Spectrometry](https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/) initiative.

But what matters the most, in my eyes, and what in the end leads to
the most precious recognition, are the **values** that we carry with
the research we do, and the **intrinsic motivation** that drive us.


We were also asked to prepare answers to three short questions. These
have been pre-determined by the HUPO ECR to get things going and give
the panellists a chance to think about the comments we would like to
make.

> When hiring a new postdoctoral researcher for your group, what are
> the most important attributes for them to have on their CV? What do
> you look for other than publication history?

Here are a couple of things I look for, and that I consider absolutely
essential, much more important than papers. Papers are only one of the
attributes that will help me assess the following:

- Does the candidate's skills match the project's needs?
- What are **concrete signs of mastery**? I perform regular (and
  constructive) appraisals with the researchers in my group, and one
  question in that appraisal is "What do you want to become an expert
  in?". In a CV, I want to find what the candidate is an expert in,
  whey they can teach me/bring to the lab.
- I also need to see public/open `code`, such as for example
  **active** Github/Gitlab profiles and repositories and
  **contributions** (to their or other's code base).

And of course, last but not least, will the person be a good lab/team
member? It is of course very difficult (and arguably subjective) to
assess, but we (the lab) will be attentive to red flags pointing to
the contrary. In case of doubt, I will invite the candidate on site if
the interview (always with the whole group) was remote. I wouldn't
want to take any risks that could harm the cohesion and well-being of
the group.

> How would you recommend that ECRs promote their work other than
> research e.g., teaching, outreach, committee work? Is there anything
> they can do other than add a line on their CV?

- Yes, 'add lines' to your CV, but not at all costs. Be pragmatic! Not
  need to run or teach workshops several time a year to demonstrate
  that you have done some teaching. Don't forget that your post-doc
  years should be the most productive research-wise of your career!
- Promote **your research**, don't be a vehicle for some else's
  research (typically your advisor), don't limit yourself to merely
  doing it. Show how you go the extra mile - for example by delivering
  reproducible research.
- **Do things you like!** Nothing beats motivation when it comes to
  convincing others that you are good at what you do.


> How much does networking (either via social media or in-person
> meetings) play a role in promoting your work?


It is **very important!** Networking are opportunities to learn,
share, discuss, and make yourself known, ... Networking can be hard
though, so don't be too hard on yourselves. It takes time.

Here's a simple example illustrating the importance of building a
network: I happily spare myself organising and running interviews when
I can find a candidate in my direct or indirect network.

To build that network, there's of course the in-person or remote
conferences and workshops, there may be social media (might not be for
everybody), but also Github issues and code/doc/typo
contributions. The latter a very concrete examples that address the
first question above.
